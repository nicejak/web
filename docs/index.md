## Current Projects
My current projects are

* My disseration on hybrid control systems and singular controls.
* Establishing [HCREAM](https://hcream.org) as a non-profit entity that benefits Hawai'i.
* As part of HCREAM, research a method to improve bus transportation by simply moving bus stops.

## Research

My mathematics specialty is in continuous optimal control, with a focus on hybrid systems. I am currently working with [Professor Monique Chyba](https://math.hawaii.edu/wordpress/people/chyba/) to demonstrate a technique for optimal control on a hybrid system with reset map the identity.

As I consider myself still a student, I do not see myself able to mentor an advanced student. Though, if you are interested in working together, please talk to me!
