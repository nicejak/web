# Hello world!
First publication to the open internet of course! Please, don't let me find out that you read this. I don't want anyone to directly know about this, but I think this is a good place to write things down.

# The first actual content
I had a particularly nostalgic night. It kept me up, and made this morning a very difficult one to start. I thought of old crushes, embarrassing moments, friends I'll never see again, and mothers that won't love me again. It's hard to come to terms with life and death, the passing of time, and the slow rotting of our minds. My past didn't have to come to haunt me, but it chose last night as an appropriate time to do so.

If I had to rank the hierarchy of people in my life, it would go:
1. My brother
2. My parents
3. My friends
4. My significant other

It's a shame, but I think doing it like this creates the healthiest relationships. It is a shame though: friends are so disposable.

* [friends]: You may forget about me, but I remember you
